Portfolio for CS250
Q: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
A: User needs are interpreted through identifying the functionalities and capabilities they expect from the software.
   User stories help with this by providing a template through which we as developers can identify these aspects and begin working to solve it.

Q: How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
A: Before I even knew the term "agile" I was using some of the practices. Since my first programming course I have heeded
   the advice of my instructors and followed the method of writing small snippets of code and compiling frequently. 
   In the real world I feel this will translate to creating one module at a time and frequently reviewing requirements and testing

Q: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A: The first and most important trait of a good team member in software development is communication. The team can only act as 
   a unit if we are all on the same page. Beyond that there is also the obvious things like sticking to dead lines and getting
   your work done so others relying on you don't fall behind as well. If something goes wrong and sets you back it's important
   to (looping back to communication) inform the team of any set backs or mishaps with the build.
